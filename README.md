# BAPBAP Balance Mod
**Please note that this mod is very much a work in progress.** I am putting it up here so that others can learn from it. I will do a proper release when the mod is more mature.

The goal of this mod is to let players tweak the numbers of augments, characters, abilties etc, by editing a .cfg file. It's only strictly necessary for the host to have the mod, but players without it are going to see the old values and not the ones the host has edited. In addition, the host should also share their configuration file with the other players.
